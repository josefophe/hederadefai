## 🧩 Why a Creator Economy?

Traditional alpha groups and trading signal channels rely on:

❌ Subscriptions
❌ Middlemen
❌ Trust

These models limit creators and exclude many consumers.

### ✔ Pay-per-use information

Buy only what you need. No subscription lock-ins.

### ✔ Fair creator monetization

Creators earn instantly — globally — with no chargebacks.

### ✔ Ultra-cheap microtransactions
