# 🚧 **Future Roadmap**

Our project lays the foundation for a fully on-chain, AI-driven creator economy. The next development milestones focus on deeper automation, richer creator tools, and complete x402 micropayment integration.

## **🔮 Phase 1 — Complete Core Micropayment Experience**

* Full Telegram integration for pay-per-signal delivery
* Add HTS–based dynamic pricing (creators can update price on-chain)
* Automated invoice creation + settlement confirmation UI
* Enable *pre-authorized* micropayment streams for high-volume users

## **🤖 Phase 2 — Autonomous AI Signal Generation**

* AI agents that can autonomously create, evaluate, and publish signals
* Creator assistant that drafts signals, pricing suggestions, and metadata
* Fraud detection AI for signal quality verification
* Auto-tagging & categorization of signals using LLM pipelines

## **📈 Phase 3 — Creator Marketplace Expansion**

* Public marketplace where users discover creators and buy signals on demand
* Creator profile pages with on-chain reputation
* Analytics dashboard: revenue, conversions, top signals, earnings history
* Review system stored on Hedera for trust minimization

## **⚙️ Phase 4 — Infrastructure & Protocol Upgrades**

* Move signals into Mirror Node + decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin)
* Add smart contract layer for governance, staking, and slashing
* Support bundles: buy 5 signals → auto-deliver with one payment
* SDK for third-party apps to integrate creator signals

## **🌍 Phase 5 — Multi-Platform Support**

* Web UI for signal browsing, purchasing and creator management
* Mobile app with instant HTS micropayments
* Plugins for Discord, Twitter/X bots, and more communication channels
* Federated signal API for external AI agents

## **💸 Phase 6 — Expanded Payment Mechanisms**

* Add recurring micropayment model (optional for creators)
* Support scheduled signal drops (pay upfront, receive over time)
* Batch micropayment engine for group deliveries
* Rewards program for consistent signal buyers

## **🛡️ Phase 7 — Compliance, Safety & Scaling**

* Automated spam + duplicate signal detection
* Verified creator identity (optional KYC for high-volume creators)
* Abuse-resistant payment flow to prevent spam requests
* Scale backend from local JSON storage → full database + caching layer
